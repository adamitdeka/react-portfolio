          Amit is a full-stack developer and graphic designer which makes him
          analytic and creative. While Amit likes creating and addressing
          problems in the digital realm, he's equally keen on extending his
          skills to actual locations or products. Amit also has a business sense
          and could see himself working on a growing team to address challenges
          that would allow the company to go further. When Amit is not coding or
